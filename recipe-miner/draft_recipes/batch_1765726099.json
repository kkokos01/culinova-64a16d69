Pat them dry with a clean cloth and season them generously with 1 tablespoon of salt. In your largest stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the pork cubes in batches, making sure not to crowd the pot, until they are golden on all sides. This gives our pozole a deeper sabor. Remove the browned pork and set aside.",
